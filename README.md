## Calling function in pycharm via postman API

To call a function in PyCharm via Postman API, you typically need to set up an HTTP server in your Python script and expose an endpoint that Postman can send requests to. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:

**Set up a Flask Server in PyCharm:**
If you haven't already, install Flask using pip:
pip install Flask

Create a new Python file in your PyCharm project and write a Flask application with a route that calls your desired function. For example:
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/call_function', methods=['GET'])
def call_function():
    # Call your function here
    result = your_function()
    return str(result)

def your_function():
    # Implement your function logic here
    return "Function called successfully!"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Run the Flask Server:
Run the Python script in PyCharm to start the Flask server. You should see output indicating that the server is running.

**Make a Request from Postman:**
Open Postman and create a new request.
Set the request type to GET.
Enter the URL of your Flask server endpoint (e.g., http://localhost:5000/call_function).
Click "Send" to make the request.

**Handle the Request in PyCharm:**
Once Postman sends the request, your Flask server will handle it and execute the call_function route.
The function your_function will be called, and its result will be returned as the response to the Postman request.

**Handle Request Parameter**
If your function requires parameters, you can pass them as part of the URL query string or in the request body, depending on your application's requirements.

**Postman API**
Postman is a popular API development tool that allows users to design, test, and document APIs. With Postman, you can create requests, organize them into collections, add test scripts, and share your work with your team.


Here's a brief overview of how to use Postman to interact with APIs:

1.Download and Install Postman: You can download Postman from the official website (https://www.postman.com/downloads/). It's available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

2.Create a New Request:

Open Postman and click on the "New" button to create a new request.
Choose the request type (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) from the dropdown menu.
Enter the request URL in the address bar.

3.Add Headers and Parameters:
If your request requires headers or parameters, you can add them in the Headers and Params tabs respectively.
Headers typically include information such as authentication tokens or content type.
Parameters are key-value pairs that are sent with the request.

4.Send the Request:
Once you've configured your request, click on the "Send" button to execute it.
Postman will display the response from the server, including the status code, headers, and body.

5.Organize Requests into Collections:
You can group related requests into collections to keep your work organized.
Click on the "New" button and select "Collection" to create a new collection.
Drag and drop requests into the collection to add them.

6.Write Tests:
Postman allows you to write test scripts using JavaScript.
Click on the "Tests" tab in a request, and you can write scripts to validate the response.
For example, you can check if certain fields exist in the response or if the status code is as expected.

7.Run Collections:
You can run entire collections of requests to automate testing or to perform a series of actions.
Click on the collection name and then click on the "Run" button to execute all requests in the collection.
